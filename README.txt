'TAP Feedback from Participants' contains transcripts from interviews where previous pilot participants were contacted and presented with a 'Tailored Action Plan' for their businessn based on the responses they had previously given when filling out the Risk Assessment Tool.

The results of these are given in 'Feedback on Tailored Action Plan (TAP)(1-4).xlxs'.
